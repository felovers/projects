ðŸ‘‹ Hey! I'm @felovers and I made this simple calculator on C# using Switch Case;

ðŸ˜… This was the second project I made when I started learning C# and having my Python knowledge in the background made it way easier.;

Now... without the emojis, I'll explain the code even though it's fairly simple;

This program starts by printing a menu on the screen, itÂ´'s just some printing so I it gave my artistic touch haha;

Then we ask the user to input the number that represents its desired option and convert it to an integer(I'll add an input validation later);

And we finally start the switch case:
- For case 1 we ask the user to input two numbers, then we sum them, and that's it;
- For case 2, it's just the same thing but we adapt the operation;
- For case 3, yet again the same thing;
- For case 4, things change. Now we have to validate if the second number is not 0, because... you know... we can't divide by 0;
    
    â€¢ We ask the user to input the first number, which we just take, no problem with that;
    
    â€¢ Now, for the second number, we'll need the validation;
    
    â€¢ Firstly, we start a loop, because as long as that second number insists on beign a 0, we'll keep telling the user that he can't use a 0 and asking for another input;
    
    â€¢ Then, we ask for the second number, that tricky one;
    
    â€¢ We start an if statement and say that if the inputted number is different from 0, than everything is okay, since the number is not a 0, then we execute the code and break the loop;
    
    â€¢ But if it is 0, we ask the user to input a number greater than 0 and keep the loop going;
   
   And that was it. Very simple isn't it?;
   
   I hope you try coding it yourself and that the explanation was clear enough (since English isn't my first language);
   
   Thank you for looking through all this and hope you have a great day/night.
   
   Bye Bye! ðŸ‘‹
